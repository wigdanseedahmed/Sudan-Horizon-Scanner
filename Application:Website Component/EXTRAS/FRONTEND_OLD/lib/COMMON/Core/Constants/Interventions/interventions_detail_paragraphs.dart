This, paired with the country’s economic challenges, has placed Sudan’s healthcare system under increasing pressure.\n\n\nDespite Sudan’s strong reputation for producing high-quality medical staff, communities have insufficient access to primary healthcare, with 1.5 facilities existing per 10,000 people, contributing to instability at the community level. This is driven by limited facilities, resources, and staff capacity - since the early 1960s, Sudan has lost almost 60 % of its physicians to outmigra- tion. Together, this contributes to the life expectancy of 65.3 years of age.\n\n\nDisease is common, particularly in displaced communi- ties, temporary settlements, and crisis-impacted areas. At present 45,000 adults are estimated to be living with HIV, while just over half (53.6%) of TB cases are effectively managed by treatment.";
const healthAndDevelopmentOurApproach = "UNDP addresses these challenges by supporting large-scale health enhancement in Sudan. As UNDP Sudan’s largest portfolio by revenue, its activities are vital in helping the country address its development challeng- es, doing so via two key areas of work.\n\n\nThe first is supporting key Ministries in providing essential services to those in need – healthcare and access to medicines – by facilitating international partner support. The UNDP-Global Fund partnership dates back to 2005 and has seen UNDP Sudan serve as the principal recipi- ent of USD\$X Global Fund grants, assisting the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) with project, procurement, supply chain and financial management, and monitoring and evaluation. These efforts see more millions of dollars of essential medicines and equipment provided annually for the treatment of HIV and TB, as well as significant support for COVID-19.\n\n\nSubsequently, our partnership with FMoH has expanded this area of work to include substantial procurement of essential medicines on behalf of the Government and improving health information management.\n\n\nOur second area of focus is strengthening Sudan’s healthcare system. This includes improvements to the health workforce – leveraging Sudan’s strong medical diaspora for capacity building and working with universi- ties to improve medical employment opportunities – and expanding health service delivery through strengthened primary healthcare (PHC) at the community and local level.\n\n\nTo support improvements in PHC, we focus on civil works and expansion or rehabilitation of local clinics, staff capacity and and supplies, and ensuring facilities are ‘smart’ - with solar energy and connectivity. These efforts are linked to our nationwide stabilization efforts, supporting Sudan’s most vulnerable and crisis-impacted communities with better access to basic services, complemented by urgently deployable mobile clinics.";

const energyAndEnvironmentTheContext = "60\% of Sudan’s population lacks access to energy, particularly in rural areas. Modern, sustainable energy solutions are a priority for development, particularly for women, improving access to basic services like health, education, connectivity, and water, as well as safety and security.\n\n\nHowever, as Sudan remains one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations, green energy options are essential.\n\n\nFortunately, the country has substantial renewable energy potential with annual average solar radiation of 2000+ kWh/m2 nationwide, and wind speeds in several states exceeding the 7.0m/s required for viable energy generation. With electricity usage increasing 13\% each year, harnessing this abundant, sustainable potential is essential.\n\n\nSimultaneously, safeguarding the environment and addressing the effects of climate change are essential for ensuring peace.\n\n\nIncreasing climate variability is driving changes in rainfall, drought, and temperature across Sudan. Compe- tition for natural resources and unsustainable depen- dance on water, agriculture, and rangelands are strain- ing the environment, increasing risk to food production, water access, and stabile communities. Together, these challenges threaten the almost 70\% of the population (and one-third of GDP) dependent on agricultur.";
const energyAndEnvironmentOurApproach = "Working at the national and community level, and drawing on a strong legacy, UNDP is expanding access to renewable energy – primarily solar – to unlock Sudan’s agriculture and economic potential, increase rural livelihoods, support stabilization, and improveaccess to basic services.\n\n\nThis includes directly funding a range of solar systems, from solar-powered water pumps for irrigation, to streetlights protecting vulnerable communities, to community mini-grids for economic development or powering health centres. In parallel, we are exploring new ways to improve access to energy for displaced and vulnerable groups, particularly in temporary or remote locations like IDP camps. To scale solar systems across Sudan, we are establishing innovative financing mechanisms – National and State Solar Funds – to ensure affordable and accessible financing is available.\n\n\nConcurrently, we are addressing environmental and climate threats to Sudan’s primarily rural, agricultural-de- pendent population, with more than USD 65M of climate-resilient rural development, livelihoods, and water initiatives underway, including civil works for dams and flood mitigation, land restoration, and environmental protection.\n\n\nFinally, across both fields, we support policy, legislation, and research support, and introduction of new technolo- gies – including Sudan’s first wind turbine, drones for climate-resilient agriculture monitoring, and solar-irriga- tion pumps.";

While significant progress has been made with the signing of the October 2020 Juba Peace Agreement and the continuation of more inclusive progress towards peace, the situation remains fragile in much of the country including Darfur, East Sudan, and Blue Nile and South Kordofan (the ‘Two Areas’).\n\n\nCompetition for natural resources and other assets, poverty, inequality and unemployment, food insecurity, and a changing climate are all potential contributors to instability. The context is exacerbated by, and also contributes to, the nearly 1.8 million internally displaced people, more than one million refugees, and some 65,000 Sudanese refugees in neighboring countries.\n\n\nHowever, Sudan has many assets that offer the chance to improve stability, including a young and determined workforce, plentiful natural resources and assets.";

This includes dissemination of the JPA, addressing hate speech and violent extremism, supporting border cooperation between Sudan and its neighbors, and preparation for DDR/SSR.\n\n\nAt the local level, we are driving a multi-agency approach to integrated community stabilization for host and displaced communities, building on work that saw more than 500,000 people assisted last year, and 55,000 seasonal jobs created, across Darfur, the Two Areas and other states.\n\n\nThese national and community level efforts are also supported by the unique efforts on Arts for Peace and Sports for Peace, drawing on passions in Sudan to bring people together in creative ways and create opportunities – core aspects of our stability work.";
